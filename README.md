Design Goals
------------

* Provide a comprehensive set of chainable assertions, being a replacement for AssertJ in most
cases
* Provide meaningful error messages
* Simplicity: no additional complexity for beeing DSLy
* Less Code: make code reusable by defining matchers on the most generic types
* Make it easy to define own assertions
